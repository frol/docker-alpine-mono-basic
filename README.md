Mono (VB.NET) Docker image
======================

This image is based on Alpine Linux image, which is only a 5MB image, and contains
[Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/).

WARNING: This mono was compiled for Arch Linux and is ported to Alpine via
[glibc hack](https://github.com/gliderlabs/docker-alpine/issues/11)! Ideally,
Mono package should be added to Alpine repo, but I don't have much time now.
